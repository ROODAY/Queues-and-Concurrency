1.
  a. Based on the results of the simulation, the Average Turnaround Time within a 
  97% CI is: 0.45 +- 0.04, which includes the true value of 0.4361 seconds. 
  Simulation can be found in part1/log.txt.

  b. Based on the results of the simulation, the Average Slowdown within a 
  97% CI is: 5.47 +- 0.44, which includes the true value of 5.29. 
  Simulation can be found in part1/log.txt.

  c. To emperically find the capacity of the system, we can continually increase 
  the lambda entering the system until the utilization of one of the devices 
  (usually the bottleneck, in this case the network) reaches ~1.0. 
  Incrementing in steps of one (lambda = 40, 41, 42...) we find the capacity to be 
  around 44, as that is the point when the network device reaches max utilization. 
  This is in line with the answer from HW 3 (44.4445). 
  Simulation can be found in part1/log2.txt.
2.
  a. Based on the results of the simulation, the Average CPU Bound Process Turnaround Time 
  within a 97% CI is: 0.092 +- 0.011 and the Average I/O Bound Process Turnaround Time 
  within a 97% CI is: 1.29 +- 0.11. This answer makes sense as now with two types of processes
  fighting for resources we can expect the average turnaround time to increase.
  Simulation can be found in part2/log.txt.

  b. Based on the results of the simulation, the Average CPU Bound Process Slowdown within a 
  97% CI is: 3.39 +- 0.26 and the Average I/O Bound Process Slowdown within a 97% CI 
  is: 23.41 +- 2.24. This answer makes sense as now with two types of processes fighting for
  resources we can expect the average slowdown to increase.
  Simulation can be found in part2/log.txt.

  c. Based on the results of the simulation, the average number of CPU bound processes waiting 
  in queues is 0.814 and the average number of IO bound processes waiting in queue is 16.128.
  Simulation can be found in part2/log.txt.
3.
  a. Based on the results of the simulation, the Average CPU Bound Process Turnaround Time 
  within a 97% CI is: 0.085 +- 0.015 and the Average I/O Bound Process Turnaround Time 
  within a 97% CI is: 0.619 +- 0.051. While the value for CPU bound processes stayed almost
  the same, the value for I/O bound processes was cut nearly in half.
  Simulation can be found in part3/log.txt.

  b. Based on the results of the simulation, the Average CPU Bound Process Slowdown within a 
  97% CI is: 3.151 +- 0.362 and the Average I/O Bound Process Slowdown within a 97% CI 
  is: 11.211 +- 0.823. Again, while the value for CPU bound processes didn't change too much, the
  slowdown for I/O bound processes was cut nearly in half.
  Simulation can be found in part3/log.txt.

  c. Based on the results of the simulation, the average number of CPU bound processes waiting 
  in queues is 0.798 and the average number of IO bound processes waiting in queue is 8.606.
  Just like in parts a and b, the value for CPU bound processes stayed relatively the same while
  the number I/O bound processes waiting in queues was cut almost in half.
